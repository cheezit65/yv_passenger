Trying to get thepackage loaded locally through localhost:3000. I had to comment out sassc-rails in the gem file. 
I'm not sure why it was there, maybe needed it for render?

I never got it to load locally, so I created a new repository. I've since uploaded the new project to yv_passenger repository. 
for that repository, i had to change the perms in the developer-settings on github.

I used putty to connect to dreamhost using the params in the last247 domain (from the dreamhost panel) to get the path & credentials.

I then had to use git to clone the new repo into the las247.com/public directory. You have to use the public directory if you're using passenger.

I installed RVM:

  # socket: /tmp/mysql.sock

#####On dreamhost, I changed postmaster info (see email on 7.1.2023 to kim)

trying to get recaptcha to work again on downloads page. NOTE: I had to go to the recaptcha page & get a new set of keys.
the recaptcha keys are stored in the recapthca.rb file.

See printed notes on KF's wall at home for instructions on how to push a package.
